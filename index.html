      <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
      <p>
        I grew up in Jacksonville, GA, and have always had a passion for learning and problem-solving. Baseball was my sport through high school and some college, and I still enjoy watching any team play. My hobbies include gaming, exploring trails, watching sports, and diving into tech.

I earned my bachelor’s degree in Interdisciplinary Studies from Valdosta State University in 2022. I then graduated, with honors, from Georgia Military College in Information Technology and discovered my true passion. Since then, I’ve learned web development with JavaScript, networking fundamentals, and earned my CompTIA A+ certification.

I’m committed to continuous growth through new certifications, coding projects, and maintaining my “Blue Team” home lab, which you can explore on my GitHub.
